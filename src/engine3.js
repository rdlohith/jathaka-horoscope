/* ================================================================
   JĀTHAKA ENGINE - marriage compatibility (Guṇa Milan / Melāpaka).

   Two charts in, one match report out. Three layers, in order of how much
   weight the classics give them:

     1. Ashtakoota  - the 36-point Guṇa Milan, koota by koota
     2. Dosha gates - Nadi and Bhakoot dosha WITH their cancellation rules,
                      because a raw score means nothing until those are checked
     3. Chart-level - 7th-lord cross-reading, Venus/Jupiter, Manglik matching,
                      daśā overlap, and the Navāṁśa (D-9) overlay, since D-9 is
                      the varga that actually governs marriage

   Every verdict carries the same five-part provenance the rest of the report
   uses: the classical rule, the grahas/bhavas that triggered it, the strength of
   the indication, the daśā window it belongs to, and a plain-language line.
   Nothing here is generated - each number is the output of the printed test.
